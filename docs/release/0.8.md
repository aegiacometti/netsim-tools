# Changes in Release 0.8

## Unified CLI

* Various scripts and Ansible playbooks are now available under a single [**netlab** command](../netlab/cli.md)
* [Legacy commands](../legacy-cli/legacy.md) are still available when forking the GitHub repository. You can also emulate them using bash aliases created with **netlab alias** command.

## Installation as a Python Package

* *netsim-tools* are available on PyPI. Installing the package also creates the **netlab** command.

## Virtual Lab Installation and Testing

* **[netlab install](../netlab/install.md)** command can used to install Ubuntu components, Ansible, or Vagrant+libvirt.
* **[netlab test](../netlab/test.md)** command sets up a fully-functional virtual test lab under VirtualBox or libvirt.

## Reorganizing Source Tree

Ansible-related source code (playbooks, tasks, templates) has been moved into `netsim/ansible` directory to include it into the _netsim-tools_ package.
